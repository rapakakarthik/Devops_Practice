How to connect to an AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu) from outside the AWS environment (e.g., from Visual Studio Code):

First, install the Remote-SSH extension in VS Code.
Open the Bash terminal on your local machine.
Navigate to the directory where your .pem key file is located.
Set the appropriate permissions for the .pem key using the command:
chmod 400 <key-name>.pem (Note: Using chmod 777 is not recommended for security reasons. chmod 400 is the standard practice for private key files.)
Verify the permissions have been applied correctly by running:
ls -l <key-name>.pem
Once the permissions are set, run the following command to connect to your EC2 instance:
ssh -i <key-name>.pem ubuntu@<public_ip_of_ec2_instance>
